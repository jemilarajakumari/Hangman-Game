A simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python.
Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess the word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman's gallows is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the gallows is complete and the player who is guessing the word is "hanged."
